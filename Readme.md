# 1v1 MCQ Battle

Creating a real-time "1V1 MCQ Battle" web application where users can challenge
each other in a quiz-based game. The application will consist of a backend built with javascript based backend framework to manage the game logic, user interactions, and data
storage, and a React frontend to handle the user interface and real-time interactions using
Pusher for websockets.

My goal is to build a fully functional web application where users can sign up, join a lobby,
challenge other players to a multiple-choice question (MCQ) battle, and answer questions in
real-time. The application will track scores and declare winners at the end of each game.
